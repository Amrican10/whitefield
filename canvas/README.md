# Whitefield Canvas

Canvas allows run-time dynamic tracking/monitoring on network. Link changes can be observed in run-time with Canvas.

In the future, we intend to use Canvas for easy to use OAM purpose. 
The nodes and networks dynamic characteristics can be probed and displayed on the canvas at run-time. 
The nodes could be added to the topology dynamically and if the node-mobility is enabled then the mobility can be visualized at run-time.
