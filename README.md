# Whitefield

Whitefield aims to provide a simulation environment for wireless sensor network by combining RF simulation provided by NS3, Castalia/Omnet++ while allowing to use native mode configuration of popular IoT OSes such as Contiki and RiOT.

Typical use of Whitefield:
1. Interoperability testing of various implementations without having to adapt to NS3 or Castalia based environment.
2. Large scale interop testing
3. Provide realistic RF environment by utilizing phy/mac of the proven RF simulators such as NS3/Castalia.
4. Validate RF phy/mac simulation against each other. For e.g. compare results in NS3 vs Castalia
