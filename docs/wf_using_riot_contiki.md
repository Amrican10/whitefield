# Using Contiki in Whitefield
## A word of whitefield's mode of integration for contiki
Whitefield is added as a TARGET platform in Contiki ([forked version](https://github.com/whitefield-framework/contiki)) of the code.
Thus any contiki application can be compiled for whitefield execution by just specifying 'make TARGET=whitefield'.

Please note Whitefield has not been tested with the Contiki-NG fork.
